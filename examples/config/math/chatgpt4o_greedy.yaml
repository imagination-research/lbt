    - {"question": "Find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.", "rationale": "The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$.\n\nAlso, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$.\n\nTherefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.", "answer": "[2,5)"}
    - {"question": "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})$.", "rationale": "We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}$.", "answer": "24"}
    - {"question": "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?", "rationale": "If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.\n\nIf he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*} 30n&=480\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16} \\end{align*}", "answer": "16"}
    - {"question": "If the system of equations \\begin{align*} 6x-4y&=a, \\\\ 6y-9x &=b. \\end{align*} has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b}$, assuming $b$ is nonzero.", "rationale": "If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain $$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a$$. Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have $$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$$.", "answer": "-\\frac{2}{3}"}
